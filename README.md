# weevil
Basic MS-DOS like operating system written in NASM and C.

# How-to
To compile the kernel from source you need a [cross-compiler](http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler). Compile it using `make` and then run using `make run`. You can also create an ISO file using `make iso`.

# State of development
Currently the project is halted because of me studying and not having enough time to work on it. When I have more time I will continue researching on the topic and will hopefully update this repository with any new code I write.
